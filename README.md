# InvertPWM
Inverted GPIOPWM for CraftBeerPi 3.
### This Plugin is for CraftBeerPi 3
This is an add on for the CraftBeerPi 3 that is an inverted form of the GPIOPWM. This Pugin is for people who run there SSRs inverted meaning that the GPIO control pin is on the neg post of the SSRs and the SSRs are being feed power constantly from a header pin. This setup is the same as you would with a Relay Board.
